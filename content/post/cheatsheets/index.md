Here are some useful cheatsheets for the tidyverse package. Tidyverse is a collection of packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 

Install tidyverse to have access to all the packages in the table below: 
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

| Package name  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Cheetsheet                                                                                                     |

| ggplot2     | ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.<br>You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical <br>primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.                                                                                 | Click [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) for cheatsheet!            |
| dplyr         | dplyr provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that <br>solve the most common data manipulation challenges.                                                                                                                                                                              | Click [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf) for cheatsheet!   |
| tidyr         | tidyr provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. Tidy data is data with <br>a consistent form: in brief, every variable goes in a column, and every column is a variable                                                                                                                                    | Click [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) for cheatsheet! |
| readr         | readr provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf).<br>It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly <br>failing when data unexpectedly changes.                                                                                          | Click [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-import.pdf) for cheatsheet!           |
| purrr         | purrr enhances Râ€™s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent <br>set of tools for working with functions and vectors. Once you master the basic concepts, <br>purrr allows you to replace many for loops with code that is easier to write and more expressive.                             | Click [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/purrr.pdf) for cheatsheet!                 |
| tibble        | tibble is a modern re-imagining of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, <br>and throwing out what it has not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less <br>and complain more forcing you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more <br>expressive code. | Click [here](>https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*fEGdnyXLzgeftfCLwvBZ5A.jpeg) for cheatsheet!                |
| stringr       | stringr provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as <br>possible. It is built on top of stringi, which uses the ICU C library to provide fast, correct <br>implementations of common string manipulations.                                                                         | Click [here](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf) for cheatsheet!              |
| forcats       | forcats provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors. R uses factors <br>to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values.                                                                                                                          | Click [here](http://www.flutterbys.com.au/stats/downloads/slides/figure/factors.pdf) for cheatsheet!           |
